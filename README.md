# class_II_UIC_PRA

This repository provides the [GoldSim](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Home/) models that are used in the manuscript entitled "Enhanced Risk to Water Resources from Collocation of Class II Disposal Wells and Legacy Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Regions".



## About the Project

This project is a scientific study of the impacts to water resources from Class II UIC disposal wells collocated with oil and gas exploration and production regions. Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methodologies are employed in the study to examine potential impacts. The PRAs are implemented in [GoldSim](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Home/) software. GitHub is used to provide open access to these models.



## What is in the Project?

Two PRAs, implemented in [GoldSim](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Home/) software, are in the project. A standard GoldSim model file (.gsm), which requires a license to use, and a [GoldSim Player](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Products/GoldSimPlayer/) file (.gsp) are provided for each PRA. [GoldSim Player](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Products/GoldSimPlayer/) allows anyone to execute and interrogate a [GoldSim](https://www.goldsim.com/Web/Home/) model without a license. The GoldSim model files are available in [goldsim_models](https://github.com/nmartin198/class_II_UIC_PRA/tree/main/goldsim_models)

1. **Class IH** disposal well system PRA

2. **Class II** disposal well system PRA incorporating modifications for addressing water resources risks from collocation of Class II disposal with legacy oil and gas exploration and production regions.
